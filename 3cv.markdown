## CV
I have a pretty diverse background.  I started out as a field biologist and then opened a restaurant.  I moved into higher ed fundraising and landed finally on research development.  I love working with faculty and supporting their research through proposal development management, editing, and stakeholder engagement.  This CV details some of those work experiences along with my own nascent research activites and products.  Hopefully, there will be much more to come.
