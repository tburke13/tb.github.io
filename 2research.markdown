## Digital Divide
My research agenda is to better understand the individual, structural and ecosystem factors contributing to the (residential) digital divide and in the long-term, develop socio-technical solutions to eliminate affordability, access, and adoption issues and reconstitute equitable governance models that result in ubiquitous digital access.

Below are work products that exemplify my current thinking and understanding of this complex and pernicious problem.

## Theory Background
These papers were produced as part of my PhD coursework.  While I have developed skills in stakeholder management from years of work, I am still learning the theoretical and epistomological underpinnings of the digital divide.

- **[Digital equity topical bibliography](/papers/bib.pdf)**  

## Funded Work
I have been very fortunate to have received two awards to support this work.  Below is a portion of one proposal detailing the rationale and research plan/activies.
- Award #1: Maryland Office of Statewide Broadband: MD-Digital Incluson Grant program ($95K, September 2022 -June 2024)
- Award #2: University of Maryland **[Grand Challenge Individual Project](https://research.umd.edu/digital-equity-mapping)** ($150K, March 2023 - August 2026)
