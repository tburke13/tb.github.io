## Smart Cities Projects
In my job, I support Smart Cities, socio-technical research at UMD under an initiative jointly supported by the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation's National Center for Smart Growth Research and Education and the College of Information Studies.  Below are three projects on which I have been a team member.

## SCC Planning: How Can Investments in Smart Cities Technologies Improve the Lives of Low-Income, Inner-Baltimore City Residents
- PI: Gerrit Knaap and Vanessa Frias-Martinez
- [NSF Award #1737495](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1737495&HistoricalAwards=false)
- The contours of the digital divide became clear to me while supporting this 2017 project. The team of technical and social scientists from the University of Maryland, University of Baltimore, Morgan State University, and Johns Hopkins University, sought to understand how investments in 5G and smart cities technology could improve the lives of West Baltimore residents. They created an asset-and-community-based approach that surfaced needs including: (1) stable, good-paying jobs; (2) safety without surveillance; and (3) ubiquitous residential broadband access [read the publication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2019.1672082); [visit the team website(https://www.umdsmartgrowth.org/city/baltimore-smart-cities-project/).
