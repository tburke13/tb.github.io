## Smart Cities Projects
In my job, I support Smart Cities, socio-technical research at UMD under an initiative jointly supported by the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation's National Center for Smart Growth Research and Education and the College of Information Studies.  Below are three projects on which I have been a team member.

## 5G and Baltimore
- PI: Gerrit Knaap (UMD-Urban Studies)
- Co-P: Vanessa Frias-Martinez (UMD-iSchool and UMIACS)
- **[NSF Award #1737495](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1737495&HistoricalAwards=false)**
- The contours of the digital divide became clear to me while supporting this 2017 project entitled, SCC Planning: How Can Investments in Smart Cities Technologies Improve the Lives of Low-Income, Inner-Baltimore City Residents. The team of technical and social scientists from the University of Maryland, University of Baltimore, Morgan State University, and Johns Hopkins University, sought to understand how investments in 5G and smart cities technology could improve the lives of West Baltimore residents. They created an asset-and-community-based approach that surfaced needs including: (1) stable, good-paying jobs; (2) safety without surveillance; and (3) ubiquitous residential broadband access **[read the publication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2019.1672082)**; **[visit the team website](https://www.umdsmartgrowth.org/city/baltimore-smart-cities-project/)**.  The Artboard below is by Ariston Jacks and captures the discussion from a community conversation focus group.

## IoT Stormwater Project
- PI: Marccus Hendricks (UMD-Urban Studies)
- Funded by the UMD [Sustainability Grants Program **[see recipient list under 2018-2019 year](https://sustainability.umd.edu/about/sustainability-fund/grant-recipients)** 
- This project entitled, A Smart, Connected and Sustainable Campus Community (IoT Stormwater Project) at the University of Maryland (UMD), has 15 multidisciplinary partners in UMD Facilities and 4 UMD schools/colleges. The goal is to use an IoT framework to monitor and improve stormwater management on campus. This project provides real-time and continuous data that can inform both short-term responses and longer-term restoration retrofits to treat stormwater surface runoff. Future research goals include improving climate resilience through science-based decision support in our hyper local region. My role is as the project manager: equipment deployment and maintenance, data collection, and team management.  I supported the initial team build and proposal development process.  The project has been successfully executed on campus; phase II is under development and includes expansion into community with iSchool faculty Tammy Clegg and Beth Bonsignore bringing new expertise to the team **[IoT project website](https://www.umdsmartgrowth.org/city/iot-stormwater-at-umd/)**.


## Park WiFi
- PI: Nirupam Roy (UMD-Computer Science)
- Community Partner: Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Prince Georges County Parks
- Co-PIs: Elizabeth Bonsignore (UMD-iSchool), Naomi Sachs (UMD-Landscape Architecture), Jennifer Roberts (UMD-School of Public Health), and Lauren Belle (M-NCPPC)
- Funded by NSF Smart and Connected Communities Program **[NSF Award # 2125526](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2125526&HistoricalAwards=false)**
- My role on this project entitled, SCC Planning: Park WiFi as a BRIDGE to Community Resilience (UMD)was as senior personnel supporting stakeholder management and digital equity questions.  The project proposed a new model to Build Resilience through the Internet and Digital Greenspace Exposure (BRIDGE), leveraging off-the-shelf WiFi technology, novel algorithms, community assets, and local partnerships to lower the cost of greenspace WiFi and ensure long-term governance. BRIDGE adapts a sustainable WiFi infrastructure through direct donations of internet bandwidth from geographically proximate community donors (e.g., schools, churches).
  
- I presented this **[poster](/papers/INSciTS.pdf)** at the INSciTS 2023 Annual Conference in Bethesda, MD (July 2023)
- The graphic below is the BRIDGE theoretical framework.
