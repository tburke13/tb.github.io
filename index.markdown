Hello! My name is **Tara Burke**. I work at the University of Maryland doing Research Development. I also study digital equity problems as a part-time PhD student (~2027!) via community engaged research methods. The digital divide is the gap between people who have access to broadband internet, computers, and knowledge of how to use both, and those who do not. In urban neighborhoods digital divides tend to reinforce pre-existing social, racial, and economic divides and exacerbate existing inequalities, like access to education and health care.

## **Experience**
- Research development and practice professional
- PhD student in Information Studies (part-time) 
- Fundraiser (past)
- Math tutor (5th grade)

## **Research**
**Overview** Equity advocacy and emancipation can only be waged and won by those actively and ubiquitously engaged in digital places.  Digital divide research is so needed because living without high-quality residential internet access makes life literally banjaxed. When there is no access, its hard to advocate for oneself.  Better understanding root causes and hyperlocal conditions, will enable us to apply “sticky” solutions that last and meet community needs.  

**Gap**  Underpinning the 20+ year inability to solve residential digital access issues, is a lack of data with enough mapping granularity that details exactly what and where the barriers are, and why they exist.  Urban issues include: (1) Lack of infrastructure - last mile fiber or fixed-antennae-wireless; (2) Affordability: infrastructure is present but individuals cannot afford it; (3) Granularity: lack of information at the exact address level; Internet Services Providers have this information, but it is closely guarded data; (4) Quality: individual has access, but quality (speed/bandwidth) is poor – often below advertised speeds; and (5) Friction: signing-up for or negotiating rates/service is difficult.  

## **Drivers** 
- Digital Emancipation
- Technology, People, and the Natural World
- Participatory Action and Advocacy
- Community Wealth Building Models

## **Research Importance**
My research interest is to better understand the individual, structural and ecosystem factors contributing to the digital divide and in the long-term, develop socio-technical solutions to eliminate affordability issues and reconstitute equitable governance models that result in ubiquitous digital access.

## **Theoretical Lenses**   
This research draws from the intersection of several theoretical lenses including: Infrastructure Studies, Foraging Theory, Feminism and the effects on power imbalances on the development of data maps.
