Hello! Tara Burke here. I work at the University of Maryland doing Research Development. I also study digital equity problems as a part-time PhD student (2026!) via the intersections of foraging theory, information infrastructure studies, feminism, and community engaged research methods. Digital divide research is so needed because living without access makes life literally banjaxed. When we know more, we can apply “sticky” solutions and address root causes.

## Research
**Overview** Equity advocacy and emancipation can only be waged and won by those actively and ubiquitously engaged in digital places.  The digital divide is the gap between people who have access to broadband internet, computers, and knowledge of how to use both, and those who do not. In urban neighborhoods digital divides tend to reinforce pre-existing social, racial, and economic divides and exacerbate existing inequalities, like access to education and health care.

**Gap:** Underpinning the 20+ year inability to solve this problem, is access to data and granularity in mapping that details exactly what and where the barriers are, and why they exist.  Urban issues include [4-11]: (1) Lack of infrastructure - last mile fiber or fixed-antennae-wireless; (2) Affordability: infrastructure is present but low-income individuals cannot afford it; (3) Granularity: lack of information at the exact address level; Internet Services Providers have this information, but it is closely guarded data; (4) Quality: individual has access, but quality (speed/bandwidth) is poor – often below advertised speeds; and (5) Friction: signing-up for or negotiating rates/service is difficult (price obfuscation marketing).  

**Agenda** My research interest is to better understand the individual, structural and ecosystem factors contributing to the digital divide and in the long-term, develop socio-technical solutions to eliminate affordability issues and reconstitute equitable governance models that result in ubiquitous digital access.

## Research Importance
Machine learning models are becoming more embedded in our everyday lives. Without a diverse and inclusive dataset, models will be inaccurate for people on the edges of the population, including those with disabilities. However, researchers are motivated by general success of their model, and it has not been demonstrated that including representative data from the edges of the population improve overall performance on the general population. Therefore, representation in datasets remains a significant challenge.

## Theoretical Lenses   
My research draws from the intersection of several theoretical lenses:
