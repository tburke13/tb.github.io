Hello! Tara Burke here. I work at the University of Maryland doing Research Development. I also study digital equity problems as a part-time PhD student (2026!) via community engaged research methods. Digital divide research is so needed because living without access makes life literally banjaxed. When we better understand root causes, we can apply “sticky” solutions that last and meet community needs.

## Experience
- Research development and practice professional
- PhD student in Information Studies (part-time) 
- Fundraiser (past)
- Math Tutor (5th grade)

## Research
**Overview** Equity advocacy and emancipation can only be waged and won by those actively and ubiquitously engaged in digital places.  The digital divide is the gap between people who have access to broadband internet, computers, and knowledge of how to use both, and those who do not. In urban neighborhoods digital divides tend to reinforce pre-existing social, racial, and economic divides and exacerbate existing inequalities, like access to education and health care.

**Agenda** My research interest is to better understand the individual, structural and ecosystem factors contributing to the digital divide and in the long-term, develop socio-technical solutions to eliminate affordability issues and reconstitute equitable governance models that result in ubiquitous digital access.

## Drivers 
- Digital Emancipation
- Technology, People, and the Natural World
- Participatory Action and Advocacy
- Community Wealth Building Models

## Research Importance
My research interest is to better understand the individual, structural and ecosystem factors contributing to the digital divide and in the long-term, develop socio-technical solutions to eliminate affordability issues and reconstitute equitable governance models that result in ubiquitous digital access.

## Theoretical Lenses   
My research draws from the intersection of several theoretical lenses including Infrastructure Studies, Foraging Theory, Feminism and the effects on power imbalances on maps:
