- I am interested in taking courses that will help me improve my: statistical knowledge, data visualization abilities, and programming skills.  I am really excited about the legal research for information professionals that I plan to take next year.
- The table below shows my full research (and life balance) plan.  Since I am actively engaged in my dissertation research (per the two funded awards), I may amend the courses of interest to better prepare me to handle challenges I am finding on the ground.  Courses I have taken are shaded in grey.
- A note about teaching...I am interested in TA'ing a course and better understanding pedagogy but, I with a full-time job and burgening research project (it's like an octopus!) it hasn't made it into the plan yet.  I am sure it will happen, though!
